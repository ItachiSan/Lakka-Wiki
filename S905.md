If you cannot boot to Lakka and you are stuck either on the device splash screen or Lakka flower, or get an error message, first try to replace the `dtb.img` file with the one suitable for your device from [here](https://kszaq.libreelec.tv/s905/8.2/device_trees/S905/).

### Other S905 variants
If you want to run Lakka on a device like S905X, you can still flash the S905 image, but you will have to use a different DTB (`dtb.img`) from [here](https://kszaq.libreelec.tv/s905/8.2/device_trees/) specific to your device.
