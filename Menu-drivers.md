## RetroArch has many graphical interfaces

RetroArch has more than one graphical interface. These are refered as *menu drivers*. You can switch to alternate menu drivers.

The menu drivers you can find in Lakka are:

  * **rgui** - The old good grey and green menu, works well on low performance devices
  * **glui / materialui** - An interface for touch devices
  * **xmb** - The default menu of Lakka
  * **zarch** - A mouse driven menu, disabled in Lakka

## Switching menu drivers

Go to **Settings->Driver settings->Menu Driver**, switch to the menu driver of your choice, then **Quit RetroArch** to have this setting applied.
