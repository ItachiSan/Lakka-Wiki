The default white & red theme provided in Lakka is called **Monochrome**. The other complete theme is called **RetroActive** and has colored icons with a transparent border. There is also a work in progress theme, **FlatUI**. A fourth option, the **Custom** theme, allows you to design your own.

From april 2016, you can switch to one of the other available themes. For this, go to **Menu Settings**, and change the **XMB Theme** option.
