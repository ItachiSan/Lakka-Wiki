Warning: this page refers to features or interfaces present on the development version of Lakka.

RetroArch will allow you to rewind your game in real time.

This video demonstrate the rewind feature:

To enable rewinding, go to Settings->Rewind, and set it to ON.

If you don't use a keyboard and prefer controlling everything with a joypad, you will have to bind the rewind hotkey to a button of your pad:
