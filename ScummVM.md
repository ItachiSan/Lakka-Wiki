## Playlist support

ScummVM is now supported by scanning process. You need to place the game data files inside a folder named by the game short name from ScummVM. The game IDs can be found in [ScummVM's compatibility list](http://scummvm.org/compatibility).
For example, if you want to play **The Secret of Monkey Island** you need to put your files inside a folder named **monkey**. You should get a [playlist](Playlists) like 

    /storage/roms/scummvm/monkey/monkey.000
    Secret of Monkey Island, The (CD/DOS)[!]
    /tmp/cores/scummvm_libretro.so
    ScummVM
